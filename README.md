# Chess-Program
Course: Software Project, Spring 2014, Tel-Aviv University

The Chess Program project is an implementation of a fully-functioning two-player Chess game.

The program was written in pure C, using the SDL framework for graphics.

The program has two modes:

1. Graphical mode (Gui mode) - The graphical mode presents the user with visual menus and controls enabling the user to play Chess, choose the game’s players (user or AI), and set the game’s difficulty.

2. Console mode - The console mode will operate in a similar way to the description [file] (readme/Basic-Console-Game.pdf).

For AI, the Minimax algorithm is used, with pruning to improve its efficiency.


Project details are described under [readme](readme).
